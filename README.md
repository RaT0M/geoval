# geoval

Geoval is a package that provides a) a data model for geospatial data, b) a lot of functionality to analyize this data, c) plotting library to generate nice looking plots.

It's application is in particular to support scripting of scientific code in the Earth and Climate sciences.

The overall mission is to help you focus on your work and not on the scripting itself. If you know how to use the different geoval components, it allows you to write very short, but powerful data analysis scripts.
